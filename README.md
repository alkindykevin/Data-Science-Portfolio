# Kevin's DS Project Portfolio
Hello, everyone 👋 👋   
This repository houses a collection of data science projects that I and my group produced for academic and self-study purposes. The source codes and contents of the projects are presented using Python Notebooks and R markdown files.

## List of Projects

### [1. Predicting Late parcel delivery in Electronic e-commerce | DS Bootcamp Final Project](https://github.com/alkindykevin/Project-1-Late-Parcel-Delivery)
- This is a collaborative project as requirement to graduate from a Data science bootcamp.
- Contributed to EDA, data pre-processing, modelling and evaluation.
- Built a predictive model to increase delivery performance & minimize the potential loss of revenue.
- Focused on recall to avoid incorrectly predicting parcels that are late but marked as delivered on time. 
- The model is trained by using 5 algorithms, such as Logistic regression, Decision tree, Random forest, KNN, SVC, and XGBoost.
- Decision Tree algorithm with hyper-parameters tuning has a good balance between its score, also neither underfitting nor overfitting.

**Tools : *Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn***

### [2. Predicting passengers who survived the titanic shipwreck | Kaggle Competition](https://github.com/alkindykevin/Project-2-Predicting-passengers-who-survived-the-titanic-shipwreck)
- Built Machine learning modelling using 6 machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic regression, Decision tree, Random forest, KNN, SVC, Gradient Boosting,and XGBoost.  
- The best model is XGBoost with hyper-parameters tuning and achieve the accuracy of 77%.

**Tools : *Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scipy, Sklearn***

### [3. 30 DAYS of ml kaggle competition - tabular playground series | Kaggle Competition](https://github.com/alkindykevin/Project-3-30-DAYS-of-ml-kaggle-competition-tabular-playground-series)
- To apply the linear regression with the least RMSE score.
- Achieved the 1344th position of 7573 participants with RMSE of 71.671%.

**Tools : *Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn***

### [4. Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Prediction | USM ML Final Project Group](https://github.com/alkindykevin/Project-4-CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE-CVD-PREDICTION-USING-SUPERVISED-MACHINE-LEARNING)
- Predicting the probability of patients having CVD in the future by using Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) with a focus to maximize recall by at least 95%.
- Contributed to EDA, data pre-processing, modelling & evaluation
- The combination RF & random over-sampling method achieved the best scores for all evaluation metrics with a precision of 86.9%, recall of 97.3%, & AUC of 94.9%.

**Tools : *Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn***

### [5. Groceries customers segmentation | USM DS Final Project](https://github.com/alkindykevin/Project-5-Groceries-customers-segmentation)
- Built a clustering model for segmenting grocery customers to decide how to relate to customers in each segment to optimise each customer's value to the business.
- K-means algorithm is used to do clustering. K-means can cluster the data points well and separate the customers into three segments.

**Tools : *R, Ggplot***
